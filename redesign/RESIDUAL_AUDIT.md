# RESIDUAL_AUDIT: every element of VLC's current interface vs the redesign

**NOTHING IS REMOVED UNTIL TONY DECIDES.** This file only marks where each element of VLC master's current Qt/QML interface ends up in the redesign. No element is deleted from the code because of this file. Elements marked NOT IN VIDEO stay in the app, working as today, until Tony decides about them (section "Decisions needed from Tony").

Sources: `redesign/reference/frames_work/vlc_ui_inventory.md` (the 380 elements, same grouping and names), `redesign/VIDEO_INDEX.md` (rows P*, IA*, IB*, F*, Decisions (Tony) and (Claude)), `redesign/FIGMA_FLOWS.md` (prototype menus and specs), `redesign/BUILD_PLAN.md` section 0 (Step 1 UI only / Step 2 new features). Written 2026-10-13.

## Marks
- **KEEP**: the element exists in the redesign at the same kind of place. The row names the VIDEO_INDEX row(s) or Figma element.
- **MOVE**: the function stays but its entry point moves. The row says exactly where.
- **NOT IN VIDEO**: not shown anywhere in the video or the Figma file. The row also says what VLC function it gives, whether that function is reachable elsewhere in the redesign as planned, and "Unreachable if removed: yes / no".
- **?**: unsure; the row explains why.

## Planned entry points used in this file (assumptions)
- **main "..."**: the top bar "..." menu, final Figma version (Decision 2): Open File(s) Ctrl + O, Open Folder Ctrl + F, Open Network Stream Ctrl + N, Open Disc Ctrl + D, Open Capture Device Ctrl + C, Convert Ctrl + R, Open Recent >, Profile >, Keyboard Shortcuts, Customize Player, Settings Ctrl + P, About VLC Shift + F1.
- **right-click**: the right-click menu (P2-23, right-click menu.png): Play, Stop, Previous Item, Next Item, Record, Hide UI (Ctrl + \), Playback >, Video >, Audio >, Subtitle >, More Settings >, Playlist >, Open Media >, Quit VLC. Its submenus keep VLC's submenus, so **RC > Playback**, **RC > Video**, **RC > Audio**, **RC > Subtitle** are VLC's Playback, Video, Audio, Subtitle menus; **RC > More Settings** is the former Tools + View menus (P2-23); **RC > Open Media** is VLC's Open Media submenu (Open File, Open Directory, Open Disc, Open Network, Open Capture Device). VLC master's popup has no Playlist submenu, so the content of **RC > Playlist** is still to be defined when it is wired (Decision 14); this file does not count anything as reachable through it. Decision 14 wires About VLC, Quit VLC, More Settings, Open Media and right-click Playlist to real actions.
- **HK**: hotkeys. Decision 22 keeps every VLC default shortcut (core hotkeys and Qt window shortcuts), adds Ctrl+\ = Hide UI and Ctrl+B = create bookmark, and ignores the prototype's F and V bindings.
- **Settings > page**: the new Settings dialog (P8-02 to P8-22). Every page has "Advanced Options" (P7-14, P8-22), and BUILD_PLAN section 2 keeps VLC's old preferences dialog reachable from Advanced. An option that only lives there is written "full preferences" and counts as reachable (but very hidden).
- **Customize palette**: the items she shows at 19:12 (P8-24, P8-46): Spacer, Divider, Playback Speed, Forward 10s, Backward 10s, Forward 15s, Backward 15s, Stop, Repeat, Shuffle, Record, Snapshot, Picture in Picture, HDR, Zoom, Right Sidebar, Quit VLC, VLC Settings, Go Home, Thumbnail, File Name, Artist Name, Folder Name, Playlist Name, Properties, Replay, Chapters, Favorite, Bookmark, Bookmarks, Playlists. W8.1a restyles VLC's existing toolbar editor, so other existing control types could stay in the palette, but they are not shown.
- **Right sidebar** = gear sidebar with tabs Playback / Video / Audio / Subtitles. **Queue sidebar** = Queue / Bookmarks / Chapters (Decision 3). **Tracks popup** = Video / Audio / Subtitles popup from the audio and subtitle buttons (Decision 5).
- Rows that show old VLC only as a problem (for example P5-04 Browse, P6-08 Open Media dialog) do not count as the redesign showing that element.
- **Unreachable if removed**: would the VLC function become unreachable if this element were removed, counting KEEP / MOVE entry points, hotkeys, Settings pages (including full preferences), the Customize palette and the right-click submenus, but NOT other NOT IN VIDEO elements (they are removal candidates too). For KEEP and MOVE rows the column says "-".
- Step 2 successors (BUILD_PLAN section 0) are flagged, for example "Step 2 W4.3b": the old entry must stay until that package lands.

## 1. Main menu bar and popup menus

### 1.1 Media menu (VLCMenuBar::FileMenu)

| Element | Mark | Where in the redesign / reason | VLC function | Unreachable if removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open File... (Ctrl+O) | KEEP | main "..." > Open File(s) Ctrl + O (P6-11, P8-27, Figma menu.png); RC > Open Media > Open File; HK Ctrl+O | Native file picker, plays the selection | - |
| Open Multiple Files... (Ctrl+Shift+O) | MOVE | Merged into main "..." > Open File(s) (P6-11: "Open Multiple Files merged into Open File(s)"). The full Open Media dialog (File tab) stays reachable from RC > Open Media > Open File... and HK Ctrl+Shift+O (Decision 22). W6.4 splits and restyles the open dialogs. | Full Open Media dialog on the File tab (several files, subtitle file, more options) | - |
| Open Directory... / Open Folder... (Ctrl+F) | KEEP | main "..." > Open Folder Ctrl + F (Figma; the video says "Open Folder(s)", P6-11); RC > Open Media; HK Ctrl+F | Pick a folder and play it | - |
| Open Disc... (Ctrl+D) | KEEP | main "..." > Open Disc Ctrl + D (P6-11, Figma), its own dialog (P6-12, W6.4); RC > Open Media; HK Ctrl+D | Open Media dialog, Disc tab | - |
| Open Network Stream... (Ctrl+N) | KEEP | main "..." > Open Network Stream Ctrl + N, new dialog (P6-13, IB-29); library Network > "+ Add Network Stream" (P6-07); HK Ctrl+N | Open a network MRL | - |
| Open Capture Device... (Ctrl+C) | KEEP | main "..." > Open Capture Device Ctrl + C (P6-11, Figma); RC > Open Media; HK Ctrl+C | Open Media dialog, Capture Device tab | - |
| Open Location from clipboard (Ctrl+V) | ? | Shown in both video menu versions (P2-21 at 5:08, P6-11 at 13:08 as "Open from Clipboard Ctrl + V") but not in the final Figma menu that Decision 2 picked. Only HK Ctrl+V stays (Decision 22, paste with confirmation). | Opens the URL found in the clipboard | no (HK Ctrl+V only, no visible entry) |
| Open Recent Media > (10 recent items) | KEEP | main "..." > Open Recent > (P6-11, Figma); also library rail Recent (P6-19), Home Continue Watching (P6-20); HK Ctrl+1..Ctrl+0 | Play a recent media from the ML history | - |
| Open Recent Media > Clear | MOVE | Settings > Privacy > History > "Clear history now" (P8-07). The Open Recent submenu content is never shown, so whether Clear also stays inside it is unknown. | MLRecentMediaModel::clearHistory | - |
| Save Play Queue to File... (Ctrl+Y) | ? | Shown as "Save Playlist to File Ctrl + Y" in the 5:08 "for now" menu (P2-21) and removed from the final menu (P6-11, Figma). The queue sidebar header has only sort, repeat, shuffle, minus, plus (IB-19). Playlist "..." > Export Playlist (F-11) exports saved ML playlists, not the queue. Only HK Ctrl+Y stays (Decision 22). | Export the play queue to m3u / xspf / html | no (HK Ctrl+Y only, no visible entry) |
| Convert / Save... (Ctrl+R) | KEEP | main "..." > Convert Ctrl + R (P6-11, Figma); library file "..." > Convert (P6-17, F-12); HK Ctrl+R | Open dialog in Convert mode, then the Convert dialog | - |
| Stream... (Ctrl+S) | MOVE | Library file "..." > Stream (P6-17, F-12) and HK Ctrl+S (Decision 22). It is in the video's final menu (P6-11) but not in the Figma menu that Decision 2 picked. Stream defaults live in Settings > Recording > Streaming (P8-17). | Open dialog in Stream mode, then the Stream Output wizard | - |
| Quit at the end of play queue (checkable) | ? | Probably Settings > Playback > Order > "When playback finishes" (P8-09; its value list is never shown). That is a saved setting, not a one-session toggle. The Sleep Timer "End of current file" (Decision 23) stops playback, it does not quit. | PlaylistController::setMediaStopAction(MEDIA_STOPPED_EXIT) | no if the "When playback finishes" list gets a "Quit VLC" value (W6.2), otherwise yes |
| Close to systray | NOT IN VIDEO | Not shown. The tray is outside the redesign; Settings > Interface has a "Notifications and System Tray" section (P8-06, rows not shown). | Hide the main window to the tray (VLCSystray::toggleUpdateMenu) | yes (only the tray menu, also NOT IN VIDEO, does the same) |
| Quit (Ctrl+Q) | MOVE | right-click > Quit VLC Ctrl + Q (P2-23, wired by Decision 14); Customize palette "Quit VLC" (P8-24); top bar close button (P2-09); HK Ctrl+Q. Not in the main "..." menu. | DialogsProvider::quit, libvlc_Quit | - |

| Bookmarks > Manage (Ctrl+B) | MOVE | Queue sidebar > Bookmarks tab (P7-05) takes over the dialog's job; RC > Playback > Bookmarks > Manage keeps the old dialog. Ctrl+B is reassigned to "create bookmark" (Decision 22, Step 2 W4.8b), so Manage loses its shortcut. | Edit Bookmarks dialog | - |
| Bookmarks > (bookmark list, tear-off) | MOVE | Queue sidebar > Bookmarks tab, click a row (P7-05); RC > Playback > Bookmarks; HK F1..F10 (see the F1/F10 clash in Upstream issues) | Jump to an ML bookmark | - |
| Renderer > <Local> | MOVE | Right sidebar > Video tab > "Render" dropdown [Local] (P4-27, Decision 24); RC > Playback > Renderer | Play locally (no renderer) | - |

| Speed > Slower | MOVE | Same as Faster; HK "-" | PlayerController::slower | - |
| Jump Forward | MOVE | RC > Playback > Jump Forward; Customize palette Forward 10s / Forward 15s (P8-24); music bar forward 15 (P6-05); HK Shift/Alt/Ctrl+Right; step sizes in Settings > Controls > Skip Amounts (P8-08) | PlayerController::jumpFwd | - |
| Jump Backward | MOVE | RC > Playback > Jump Backward; Customize palette Backward 10s / Backward 15s; music bar rewind 15 (P6-05); HK Shift/Alt/Ctrl+Left | PlayerController::jumpBwd | - |
| Jump to Specific Time (Ctrl+T) | MOVE | Click the current time label and type a time (F-02, W3.5); RC > Playback > Jump to Specific Time; HK Ctrl+T | Go to Time dialog | - |

| Previous | MOVE | right-click > Previous Item P (P2-23); control bar Previous (P1-14); HK p | PlaylistController::prev | - |
| Next | MOVE | right-click > Next Item N (P2-23); control bar Next (P1-14); HK n | PlaylistController::next | - |
| Record | MOVE | right-click > Record (P2-23); Customize palette "Record" (P8-24); HK Shift+R. Note: the Figma right-click menu labels it "R"; Decision 22 keeps VLC's Shift+R (plain R is Random in VLC), so the label should read "Shift + R". | PlayerController::toggleRecord | - |

### 1.3 Audio menu (VLCMenuBar::AudioMenu)

| Element | Mark | Where in the redesign / reason | VLC function | Unreachable if removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### 5.1 Qt/QML window shortcuts (GlobalShortcuts.qml, MLGlobalShortcuts.qml)

| Element | Mark | Where in the redesign / reason | VLC function | Unreachable if removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Ctrl+B changes from "Manage bookmarks" to "create bookmark" (Decision 22). These Qt shortcuts are not core hotkeys, so the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog (P7-12) does not list them unless they are added. | Same as the menu items | - |

### 5.2 Core hotkey actions with no or limited Qt UI (src/libvlc-module.c defaults)

All rows here stay because Decision 22 keeps every VLC default shortcut, and the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog (P7-12) lists the core hotkeys. The onboarding shortcut screen (P8-31) shows different keys; under Decision 22 its text must show VLC's keys.

## Decisions needed from Tony

### A. NOT IN VIDEO elements that would become unreachable if removed

Each group ends with a recommendation. Nothing here is removed until Tony decides.

**A1. Player controls that only exist as control bar buttons**
- 2.4 ATOB_BUTTON (A-B loop), 2.4 HIGH_RESOLUTION_TIME_WIDGET (SMPTE timecode), 2.4 TELETEXT_BUTTONS, 2.4 NAVIGATION_BUTTONS (its teletext part).
- Recommendation: keep all four as Customize Player palette items (W8.1a restyles VLC's toolbar editor, which already has them). Also add "A-B Loop" to RC > Playback and "Teletext" to RC > Subtitle, so they are not palette-only. Draw the A-B markers on the seek bar (2.3).

**A2. Core dialogs and feedback the core relies on**
- 2.2 Dialogs layer; 4.11 Error popup, Login dialog, Progress dialog, Question dialog; 4.9 Question / message boxes, Text input dialog; 5.3 Dialog provider events from core; 4.8 Extension dialogs; 2.2 Floating notification above control bar; 3.1 Floating notification (library).
- Recommendation: keep all, restyled with the redesign dialog frame (IB-29, FIGMA_FLOWS dialog specs) and the toast look (IB-35) for notifications. Without them, logins for network shares, TLS questions, confirmations and extensions like VLsub stop working.

**A3. Old dialogs that stay behind a menu entry but are never shown**
- 4.9 VLM configurator, Program Guide (EPG), Help, VLC media player updates; 4.6 Codec tab, Location / Save Metadata / Close, Audio Fingerprinting dialog; 4.7 Modules Tree tab; 4.8 About plugin / addon info dialogs; 4.5 v4l2 controls tab.
- Recommendation: keep them as they are, reached from RC > More Settings (VLM, Program Guide, Messages, Codec Information, Media Information, Effects and Filters), About VLC (updates) and F1 (Help). Restyle later only if wanted.

**A4. Convert, Stream and Open dialog contents**
- 4.2 Convert: Settings, Profile selector, Profile edition dialog, Destination file, Start / Cancel. 4.3 Stream wizard: Destination Setup, Transcoding Options, Option Setup, Back / Next / Stream / Cancel. 4.1 Open Media: Show more options, capture Advanced Options sub-dialog.
- Recommendation: keep the existing Convert dialog behind main "..." > Convert and the Stream wizard behind file "..." > Stream and Ctrl+S. In the split open dialogs (W6.4) keep a "More options" expander (start / stop time, extra media, custom options) and the capture "Advanced options" button.

**A5. Library**
- 3.1 Nav: Browse and 3.3 Browse home (local drives, devices, LAN shares): recommend rows "Local Network" and "Devices" in rail Network next to Podcasts and Radio (P6-07), using VLC's existing browse models, and letting "+ Add" folder pickers browse network shares too.
- 3.3 Home: Favorites row: recommend a "Favorites" section on Home in the same style as the other Home sections (P6-20), since the file "..." menu and the palette can set Favorite (F-12, P8-24).
- 3.3 Video group view (group by name): recommend dropping name grouping (folders replace it, P5-16), or keeping it as a Sorting Options extra.
- 1.10 Sort menu Albums extra: Album sections: recommend dropping it or keeping it as a Sorting Options extra on the artist view.
- 3.1 Scan progress bar: recommend a thin progress line with "Indexing ..." under the panel count row (P5-23).
- 3.1 Update pane: recommend a toast or a Home notice in the resume-toast style (IB-35), shown when the automatic check (Settings > General, P8-03) finds an update.
- 2.2 Audio player: Lyrics toggle and Lyrics view: recommend a "Lyrics" button in the music view (P6-04) or a Customize palette item, with the synced lyrics panel kept.
- 3.4 Filter search box (queue): recommend a magnifier in the queue header like the compact library (IB-12), keeping "Discard the filtered out items".
- 3.4 Detached play queue window (with 1.7 Docked Play Queue): recommend dropping both together, because Decision 3 makes the queue a sidebar everywhere; or keep both in RC > More Settings.
- 1.10 Network device context menu: recommend reusing the folder "..." menu (P5-15) on device rows.

**A6. System tray**
- 1.11 Tray icon; 1.11 Hide / Show VLC media player in taskbar; 1.1 Close to systray.
- Recommendation: keep the tray as it is (it is outside the redesigned window) and fill Settings > Interface > "Notifications and System Tray" (P8-06) with VLC's "Show systray icon", "Show media change popup" and a "Close to tray" option.

**A7. skins2 popups**
- 1.10 Skins / dialog-provider variant of popup, AudioPopupMenu, VideoPopupMenu, MiscPopupMenu.
- Recommendation: keep untouched; Settings > Interface keeps "Use a custom skin" (P8-06), and these menus are skins2's only popups.

**A8. Accessibility**
- 5.3 Tooltips and accessibility names.
- Recommendation: keep; INTERACTIONS.md section 7 already requires Accessible.name and translations on every new element.

### B. Sub-items inside KEEP / MOVE rows that lose their only entry point

These rows are marked MOVE or KEEP because the element as a whole has a new home, but these parts have none in the video or Figma:
- Play queue context menu (1.10): Jump to current playing, Show Containing Directory, Information for a non-playing item, Clear the play queue (only HK Ctrl+W), Save Play Queue to File (only HK Ctrl+Y), Discard the filtered out items. Recommend a row "..." menu in the queue that reuses the file "..." menu (F-12) plus Clear and Save in the queue header or RC > Playlist.
- ML media context menu (1.10): Play as audio, Play as album, Enqueue as album, Delete (streams), Delete File From System. Recommend adding "Delete" (with confirmation) and "Play as audio" to the file "..." menu.
- ML playlist list context menu (1.10): Rename, Delete. Recommend adding both to the playlist "..." menu (F-11).
- ML playlist content context menu (1.10): Remove from this playlist. Recommend adding it to the file "..." menu when opened inside a playlist.
- Network media context menu / Browse tree / Simple > Media Library: Remove from Media Library, banned folders, Reload All Folders. Recommend "Remove from Library" in the folder "..." menu (P5-15) and a folder list on Settings > Library.
- Subtitle track menu (1.10): "Select multiple" (dual subtitles); Subtitle sync page (2.5) and Synchronization tab (4.5): secondary subtitle delay. Recommend allowing two checked rows in the tracks popup Subtitles tab and showing a second delay slider in the Subtitles tab when a secondary track is on.
- Audio sync page (2.5): Reset and the "Sound Heard / Sound Spotted" estimator (no hotkey for audio). Recommend a small Reset next to Audio Track Delay; estimator optional.
- Audio track menu (1.10) and Video Tracks "Add" (2.5): load an external audio / video track for the playing item. Recommend an "External Tracks +" section on the Audio and Video tabs of the tracks popup, like Subtitles.
- Advanced audio (4.5): Adjust pan. Video Geometry (4.5): Interactive Zoom, Wall, Puzzle. Recommend extra expandable cards in the Audio / Video tabs or leave them in full preferences.
- Bookmarks (4.4): rename, Clear, Extract. Recommend rename by double-click on a row and Clear / Extract in a "..." on the Bookmarks tab header.
- Open Media Network tab (4.1): URL history and Clear History. Recommend relying on Recent / Latest Streams (P6-19, F-15) and a clear option in Settings > Privacy.
- First run wizard (4.9): the privacy / network access notice. Recommend keeping it as an onboarding step (VideoLAN privacy policy), with "Allow metadata network access" there.
- Simple > Interface (4.10): File extensions association (important for a Windows app), Pause playback when minimized, Interface scale factor, Pin video controls, Look and feel / custom skin choice already in Interface > Skin. Recommend adding File associations to Settings > General or Interface.
- Simple > Video (4.10): snapshot directory / prefix / format. Recommend Settings > Recording next to "Save recordings to" (P8-17).
- Toolbar Editor (4.9): separate Video / Audio / Mini player layouts. Customize Player only shows the video bar (P8-24); the music bar (P6-05) and the mini player need their own layouts or a tab in Customize Player.
- Nav: Video > All (3.1): a flat list of all indexed videos. Music > Artist detail (3.3): Play all / Enqueue all. Filter search box (3.2): case-sensitive and regex options. Hotkey table context menu (1.10): Unset, Copy value, per-row Reset. Seek slider (2.3): A-B markers, chapter-name tooltip; remaining-time label: speed-adjusted tooltip. Recommend keeping these behaviors in the new components where cheap.
- Hotkey-only after the redesign (reachable, but with no visible entry): Save Play Queue to File (Ctrl+Y), Open from clipboard (Ctrl+V), Help (F1), DVD root menu (Shift+M), frame step (e / Shift+E), Codec Information also has RC > More Settings. Recommend at least RC > Playlist for Save Play Queue and RC > Playback for the disc menu and frame step.

### C. Rows marked "?" (need a call), plus the one NOT IN VIDEO row whose reachability is unknown
- 1.1 Open Location from clipboard: in both video menus, not in the final Figma menu (Decision 2). Keep only Ctrl+V, or add "Open from Clipboard" back to main "..."?
- 1.1 Save Play Queue to File: removed in the final menu; keep only Ctrl+Y, or put it in the queue header / RC > Playlist?
- 1.1 Quit at the end of play queue: map to a "Quit VLC" value of Settings > Playback > "When playback finishes" (P8-09)?
- 1.10 QmlAudioContextMenu: confirm the right-click menu also opens on the music player view (P6-04).
- 1.10 Network media context menu: confirm that Network rows use the file "..." menu.
- 2.4 REVERSE_BUTTON: the Reverse toggle is postponed (Decision 29); keep the old button as a palette item until then?
- 5.1 F10 toggle menu bar: the menu bar is gone; let F10 fall through to the core "play bookmark 10", or keep F10 for a classic menu bar?
- 2.2 Toggle control bar button (DVD interactive mode): unreachable status unknown until tested with a real DVD menu (BUILD_PLAN risk 2).

## Upstream issues found

Copied from `vlc_ui_inventory.md` (base commit a5538c557d276378d5ba0f8f8010a8b87eaa6f78). These are bugs or gaps in VLC master itself, not in the redesign.
1. Next / Previous Frame control bar buttons are swapped in `player/qml/PlayerControlbarControls.qml`: the FRAME_PREV_BUTTON id is labelled "Next Frame" and loads `FrameNextButton.qml` (Player.frameNext), and FRAME_NEXT_BUTTON is labelled "Previous Frame" and loads `FramePrevButton.qml`.
2. Play queue context menu "Sort by" (`menus/qml_menu_wrapper.cpp` PlaylistContextMenu) reads the key "key" but the list provides "criteria", so every entry likely sorts by Title only.
3. `maininterface/qml/MainDisplay.qml` routes "mlsettings" to `MLFoldersSettings.qml`, which does not exist (dead route).
4. F1 / F10 clash: the Qt menus use F1 = Help and F10 = toggle menu bar (`menus/qml/GlobalShortcuts.qml`), while the core default hotkeys use F1..F10 = play bookmark 1..10 (`src/libvlc-module.c`).
5. A-B loop, reverse (trickplay), timecode (SMPTE high resolution time) and teletext are only reachable from control bar buttons: no menu entry and no default hotkey.
