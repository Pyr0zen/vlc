# STATUS

- Updated: 2026-10-16 (session near its limit: start nothing new until the reset; Sticky, 79 % session / 69 % week)

## Branch state (Decision 55: redesign only receives verified code)
- redesign = last verified state + docs: the unverified batch was reverted (725377056e5, [skip ci]); CLAUDE.md has Decision 55 / 58 and the StickyGonzales public-name rule.
- wip/next-batch = the batch under test: waveform full/sampled rule + Ctrl+B notification + bookmark titles, library fixes (Add Folder crash, folder contents after a scan, New Playlist dialog, narrow header, grid 5/4), Customize Player + profiles (Decisions 51-53), mouse wheel fine-tuning (Decision 54) + wheel never acts over the bars (Decision 54 updated), music player view + mini player. Test build of the first part: 38829058873 (= b525e444d84, before music / wheel-bars).
- wip/fix-panels-2 = panels / Settings fixes: reviewed (2 reviewers, fixes cc9458803b0) and MERGED into wip/next-batch. Retest list in BUILD_NOTES (Output device, Use the media library dimmed, Settings search, Disabled wording, queue drop, chapters hh:mm:ss, queue header, tracks popup gap, Stereo Mode + Test button, tooltips).
- wip/cone-release (PR #7) = Cone release gaps: REVIEWED and pushed (6a328a87a72): privacy clean; Decisions 56 / 57 / 58 and StickyGonzales in the code; core changes all public-profile-only (src/win32/dirs.c settings folder, src/win32/specific.c + modules/control/win_msg.c single-instance name, modules/audio_output/mmdevice.c + winstore.c audio session GUID); portable interface settings copied into builds\current-public\portable\Cone. Not built yet (next: its own manual build after the reset). Then its own manual build; installer side-by-side test BLOCKED: Windows Sandbox is not available (Windows 10 Home): Sticky decides (VM / other PC / Windows Pro), never install on his real Windows.
- wip/ci-release (PR #8, on top of cone-release): privacy check + safe tests after the reset: two manual build-windows runs with brand public (compare build times, cache hit rate), and one release-workflow run that must refuse. Merge order: cone-release, then ci-release, each only after it passes.

## Fix list additions (Sticky, 2026-10-16)
- The resume toast text must never be cut off ("You already watched t... 00:00:14" seen on 38829058873): it fits or wraps at every window size.
- VLC's built-in dialogs in the Cone build must say "Cone" (e.g. the AVI "Broken or missing Index" question still says "VLC won't repair..."): public profile only; core-side dialog texts are core changes (Cone release branch, own build).

## Priorities until the coded-but-unverified pile is under 50 (Sticky, 2026-10-16)
1. No new features except the 12 must-haves; bug fixes from testing come first.
2. Automated verification harness in redesign/tools/verify/: launches the test build in portable mode, drives each screen and state through Windows UI Automation and keyboard shortcuts, screenshots the player window only, pixel-diffs against the matching Figma frame at the same scale; rows within a small tolerance are marked auto-passed for review, only differences and behaviour checks need a manual look. Never commit desktop screenshots; close everything after each run.
3. Every idle window goes to verification, Player area first; rows verified per window are reported below so the pile visibly shrinks.

## Build cache (2026-10-16): verified and merged
- wip/ci-release privacy clean; two manual public runs: cold 38891929733 (ccache hit rate 2.5 %, build step 18.7 min, total 25.3 min), warm 38894781882 (hit rate 99.1 %, build step 9.6 min, total 16.9 min). Before the cache: 31-37 min per build (compile ~27 min). Same 531 files; binaries differ only in build-time stamps (PE time / checksum, debug id, container id in "compiled by", the About compile time); Cone.exe from the warm run starts, plays a file and exits cleanly.
- The cache-only part (no Cone installer / release steps) is on redesign (adc810f8a82, its first redesign build fills redesign's cache), wip/next-batch (d5e8bb9b957) and wip/cone-release (d64e548960c, keeps BRAND_VERSION). The release workflow stays on wip/ci-release.
- Found: Cone release builds reject --no-qt-updates-notif (no update checker): the test helper and both launchers now pass it to vlc.exe only.
- HIGH, to fix next: on build 38829058873 several quits left Cone.exe processes stuck in termination (1 thread, no window, cannot be killed: PIDs 19040, 11360, 58492); the smoke test of the ci-release build exited cleanly. Investigate the shutdown path (abandoned waveform worker, audio output, D3D).

## Row count (VIDEO_INDEX, updated after every testing window)
Raw statuses: verified 69, coded but not verified 172, todo 120 (of 361). The verified rows include earlier test rounds: 59 from the round on build 38727073546 (before this sweep) and 10 from this sweep on 38829058873.
The todo rows split into: context only (old VLC shots, jokes, sponsor, surveys, montage: nothing to build), built but never moved off todo (counted as coded here, they wait for verification), still to build: must-have (part of what she shows and planned) and optional (postponed reverse playback, montage-only seek segments, polish motion).

| Area | Verified | Coded, not verified | To build: must-have | To build: optional | Context (nothing to build) | Rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player (bars, look, other) | 2 | 65 | 0 | 1 | 41 | 109 |
| Sidebars, menus and panels | 7 | 71 | 3 | 3 | 13 | 97 |
| Library and music | 20 | 24 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 50 |
| Settings and dialogs | 25 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 36 |
| Step 2 features | 9 | 31 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 50 |
| Customize and profiles | 6 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 19 |
| **Total** | **69** | **212** | **12** | **5** | **63** | **361** |
| Cone release | tracked in redesign/CONE_RELEASE_NOTES.md (no VIDEO_INDEX rows) | | | | | |

- Fix list (found by the toast fix review): RdProfileNotice has the same 552 px cap and elide the resume toast had: make it fit or wrap the same way.

## Verification sweep (build 38829058873)
- Window 1 done (2026-10-16): Customize Player and profiles. Verified: row 308 (profiles in the main menu, submenu, switching). Bugs: MED Customize preview loses the seek bar and time labels after a drop; LOW profile switch drops one frame (23 ms); LOW footer tabs not in Figma (to decide). Details in BUILD_NOTES and PERF.
- Count (all VIDEO_INDEX rows): verified 62, coded but not verified 177, todo 122.
- Window 7 partly done (2026-10-16): Add Folder picker cancel x5 without a crash (pass); folder contents after a scan, grid, Unknown Album and pin highlight still untested: needs the Test Show folder added once through Videos > + Add (Sticky, one click) because the picker's Select Folder cannot be reached by guarded test input.
- Window 6 done (2026-10-16): presets switching between shows: rows 105-110 verified.
- Window 4 done (2026-10-16): Ctrl+B and bookmarks: row 247 verified (title names, notification, duplicate skip); LOW stock notification look.
- Window 3 done (2026-10-16): waveform: audio formats, no-audio file and the AVI pass; 249 MiB MP4 fails (HIGH, fix running); a Cone process stuck in termination after one quit (MED, investigate). No rows marked verified (the waveform rows wait for the MP4 fix).
- Window 2 done (2026-10-16): library part 1: New Playlist (P6-16, IB-30) verified, narrow header fixed; LOW Continue Watching shows the file name. Library part 2 (needs folders in the Cone library: Add Folder cancel, folder contents after a scan, grid, Unknown Album, pin highlight) still open.
- Window 3 (waveform) partly done (2026-10-16): HIGH the 250 MiB MP4 takes 13.5-14.9 s (target 2 s; cause found: MP4 seeks land on the video keyframe and the scanner decodes the audio before each stretch; fix: drop those packets undecoded); MKV 4.8 s and 4K MKV 2.6 s pass; log lines exist but the log file is buffered; AVI index dialog shows once, MED quit with that dialog open took 8.8 s. Left: AVI second ask + result, no-audio MP4, MP3 / M4A / FLAC, responsiveness. Continue Watching file names reclassified: matches Figma and the video (no change). Details in BUILD_NOTES.
- Fix branches (sub-agents, not merged yet): wip/sweep-fix-customize (pushed, NOT reviewed: d978ec93f97 with center controls the seek row takes its own full-width row above the controls, live bar and preview alike, so Save keeps it too (two 54 px rows as Figma "Player - customize-1/-6/-7"); dfa0f7a3b4f notes; leftover LOW: RdProfileNotice sits one bar height up and can cover the two-row seek row; needs review of everything sized from the bar height. Decision 62 (Customize footer tabs as RdSegmented between Cancel and Save, 103.5 per segment) NOT started, not recorded in VIDEO_INDEX yet), wip/sweep-fix-wheel NOT created: the wheel agent stopped at the limit before coding (plan: RdSliderWheel gets `armed` + live `inScrollingView` from the ancestor Flickables, no timers; wheel taken when armed or not in a scrolling view; old 0.4 s latch removed; RdSlider arms on press and draws a 1 dp track border (rdAccentDim) while held; value rows (RdParamSlider, SettingsRow via SettingsOption, Interface sensitivity, Video picture rows, Equalizer bands) arm by tap and release on hover-out; open points: horizontal wheel, Equalizer's horizontal Flickable counts as scrolling in narrow windows). Clean worktree ready for the waveform fix: .claude/worktrees/r4-sweep-waveform (work/sweep-waveform). Next: waveform fix branch (wip/sweep-fix-waveform), review both branches, merge into wip/next-batch, one manual public build, record its run here.
- Next windows: finish window 3, then Ctrl+B / bookmarks, mouse wheel, presets between shows, library part 2;
- Earlier plan: library part 2, waveform (large files, AVI without index, no-audio), Ctrl+B message and bookmark titles, mouse wheel, presets switching between shows; then the music view and panels on the next-batch build.
- Queued for the next batch after this testing window (Sticky, 2026-10-16): Decision 54 change: in any panel / sidebar / popup / Settings page that can scroll, the wheel always scrolls the panel and never changes a slider by hovering (remove the 0.4 s pause); a slider there takes the wheel only after a click on it or its value row, releases it when the pointer leaves the slider or on a click elsewhere, with a subtle focus state while it holds the wheel; in panels that cannot scroll, hovering is still enough. Update Decision 54 and INTERACTIONS.md.

## After the reset, in order
1. Verification sweep on build 38829058873 (green, downloaded to builds8829058873; it is a public / Cone build): by screen, highest risk first: Customize + profiles (profile-switch frame time), library fixes, waveform (large files, AVI without index, no-audio file), Ctrl+B message and bookmark titles, mouse wheel, presets switching between shows. Mark rows verified only after Figma + video; log failures; keep a verified / coded-unverified count here.
2. Fixes for failures on wip/next-batch (+ panels after review), manual build of wip/next-batch, retest; when it passes: revert the revert on redesign, merge wip/next-batch, tell Sticky.
3. Cone release: manual build of wip/cone-release, test the portable build; ci-release tests; merges only after they pass; close PR #7 / #8 after merging.
4. README with StickyGonzales on the next verified merge.
5. Proposed core change for Sticky's approval: aout_PrepareStereoMode drops the requested stereo mode on output restart (src/audio_output/output.c).

## Checks only Sticky can do
Night mode listening test; Cone tray icon (Windows hidden icons); installer side-by-side test (needs a VM / other PC / Windows Pro); OpenSubtitles with his API key; Rescan plugins from Program Files (admin prompt, needs the installer); display scaling 100 / 150 %; touchpad feel of the wheel; firewall prompts for new exe paths. Open questions: speaker-button wheel now sets the volume and the speed button no longer reacts to the wheel (Decision 54 follow-ups): keep or revert?

## Builds
- Latest green: 38727073546 (everything up to the no-dim change: library, settings pages, UX pass, onboarding, Customize Player, stall fixes, control bar, light theme, DM Mono). Hands-on tested 2026-10-15 (see BUILD_NOTES).
- Local and pushed after it: Decision 44 (light FG/A4 #8A8A8A), fixed test folder (launcher), docs. Pushing redesign starts the next build.
- Tests run from <TEST_MEDIA_DIR>/builds/current (firewall allowed once). Session helper vlctest.ps1 in the scratchpad has deploy / start current / dblclick / wheel / drag / graceful stop.

## Hands-on results of 38727073546
- Works: bars and 3 s fade, click outside closes panels (video keeps playing), Escape order, opaque tracks popup header and bar, right-click menu on the video, double-click fullscreen both ways, wheel volume, small window (no overlap), library compact, settings dialog pages, no dim behind dialogs, Customize Player overlay, Keyboard Shortcuts, onboarding (with --qt-privacy-ask), subtitle delay/speed drags do not freeze the video (frame difference measured on <TEST_MOVIE> and the test video), settings sidebar tabs match Figma closely (Q1 no footer on Playback).
- Bugs (sent to the UX agent, partly fixed on wip/a84f3cfa07ac47ba6): None + Track both checked in the subtitle list; tracks popup with 16 tracks grows past the window and clips its footer; "Disable" / "Best available" wording; right-click on the seek bar opens nothing; Ctrl+P with the main menu open leaves the menu open.
- Not bugs: --start-time ignored (stock VLC 4 does the same); the "closed abruptly" prompt after forced closes.

## Performance round 3 (perfruns/r3, back to back)
- Startup stock 927/1062/1112 ms vs redesign 1031/981/921: equal. Open file stock 1256/1130/1339 vs redesign 1671/1258/1230: equal except one slow first open. Playing CPU 0.1 % / RAM 310 vs 309 MB: equal. 4K fullscreen lost frames 23 vs 23: equal. Queue scroll p95 24 vs 20 ms.
- Redesign motion scenarios skipped (VLC lost the foreground); rerun when Sticky is away. Write into PERF.md.

## Open branches (all backed up on origin as wip/<id>, none merged)
1. wip/a84f3cfa07ac47ba6 UX leftovers: done except bug 4 (right-click on the seek bar: SliderBar.qml tap/drag handlers block the bar's right-click handler, Player.qml ~2042). Includes a C++ change (DialogsProvider dialogOpening signal, never compiled). Needs an independent review, then merge.
2. wip/a1e06ae1c89fa4775 W3.3b seek preview thumbnails: done, reviewed. Fix before merging: M1 (cancelled request clears the wanted bucket, rd_seek_thumbnailer.cpp:492-498: clear m_wanted only for non-cancelled results), M2 (length change resets cache and stops preview, :238 and :288-295: keep item/cache on same URI), LOWs L1-L9 in the review (stale threshold 600-1000 ms, re-check on throttle tick, timeouts count double, one image_handler per thread, setSupported(false) when the preparser fails, stop on SliderBar destruction, notes wording).
3. wip/a9364ffaea8630df4 Step 2 Settings rows S2-02..S2-10 and S2-03 (own tray popup): done, NOT reviewed. Needs an independent review (C++ never compiled), then merge and build. Night mode is ready for Sticky's listening test once built (Decision 38).

## Next, in order
1. Finish and merge the UX leftovers branch; fix M1/M2 (+ LOWs) on the seek thumbnail branch and merge; review and merge the Settings rows branch; one build; hands-on test with real screenshots vs Figma; perf motion rerun; PERF.md round 3.
2. Core build (Decision 27): 3553e146bc (subtitle rate change flushes only the subtitle slave) and later S2-01 / S2-11.
3. Remaining Step 2 items (BUILD_PLAN section 0).

## Rules added this session (see CLAUDE.md)
Max 4 agents in total, no sub-agents; UX pass on every package; identical to Figma, verified only by real-build screenshots; decision questions with side-by-side images in <TEST_MEDIA_DIR>/decisions; component motion from Figma/video; build list checker before pushes; fixed test folder; test media rules; never delete outside project paths.
