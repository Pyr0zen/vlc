# FIGMA_FLOWS: prototype interactions and specs from the Figma file

Source: Figma REST API `GET /v1/files/mNrr8joVY8wKLkEAuKP77p` ("VLC Redesign (Community)", version 2409521707817118521, last modified 2026-10-12), saved locally as `redesign/reference/figma/figma_file.json` (26 MB, committed). Generated from that JSON; nothing here was guessed from images. PNG names refer to `redesign/reference/figma/`.

How to read this together with the other references:
- `VIDEO_INDEX.md` = what she shows and says (primary source). This file = what the Figma prototype wires up (clicks, hovers, drags, keys, transitions) plus exact sizes. Where they disagree, see "Conflicts" below and VIDEO_INDEX "Decisions needed".
- Colors: always the style names from `figma/styles.txt` (shown here as `Dark/BG/B2=#090909`).
- A Figma prototype is a demo: some links are placeholders (for example "About VLC" opening the Customize screen). Those are listed under "Prototype wiring that is not design intent" and must not be built.

## Summary
- 2708 prototype interactions on 2197 nodes (1868 variant state changes, 356 navigate, 239 swap overlay, 181 open overlay, 34 back, 30 close overlay).
- Triggers: click 1513, hover 1127, drag 50, key 18 (keys used: F, V, Enter). No timed (after delay) or mouse-enter/leave triggers.
- 4 flow starting points: Flow 1 = Player (Player-6.png, also the page's prototype start), Flow 2 = Player - Light (Player - Light.png), Flow 3 = Player - customize (Player - customize.png), Flow 4 = Onboarding (Onboarding.png).
- 105 top-level frames, matched 1:1 to the 105 PNGs (duplicate names are numbered in layer order: first = no suffix, then -1, -2, ...; checked by eye on Player.png, Player-5.png, Player-6.png). 94 have interactions; 11 have none: thumbnail, Sorting Options, context menu, folder context menu, file context menu, playlist context menu, audio value, option, setting category, Components, Designs (these are overlay targets or labels, not starting points).
- 61 frames have interactions on their own screen; 33 component sets carry interactions inside their definitions (state machines that apply everywhere the component is used).

## Key behaviors the prototype defines
Control bar (component `Controls`, 15 variants: default, Variant10, waveform, music, queue, bookmarks, chapters, subtitles, playback, sub timeline, audio, video, video settings, audio settings, subtitle settings)
- Play button: click toggles play <-> pause (pause = gray pill `Dark/FG/A3=#6B6B6B`, play = `Dark/Accent/Main=#D37918`). Instant.
- Current time: hover gives a dark background (`Dark/BG/B2`); click turns it into an editable field with an orange 1 px caret; Enter returns to normal (type a time to jump).
- Total time (Duration): click toggles to remaining time ("-00:23:30") and back.
- Volume: hover on the speaker icon opens the "audio value" tooltip ("100 %", 121x37, 63 px above the icon). Dragging the cone switches 50% <-> 200% with smart animate 300 ms ease-in-out. The volume component has steps 0, 10..100%, 150%, 200% (max 200%).
- Seek bar: hovering the playhead opens the thumbnail overlay (272x189, 132 px left / 209 px above). Clicking the seek row toggles the waveform seek bar (prototype demo of the waveform option).
- Right-side buttons each open one panel inside the Controls component; clicking the same button again closes it, clicking another switches: subtitle button -> tracks popup on the Subtitles tab, audio button -> tracks popup on the Audio tab, gear -> settings sidebar on the Playback tab, list button -> Queue panel.
- Tracks popup (400x524): tabs Video / Audio / Subtitles switch instantly. "Show Preferences" opens the settings sidebar on the matching tab (Video -> Video settings, Audio -> Audio settings, Subtitles -> Subtitle settings). External Tracks "+" and pencil both open Add Subtitles in "To This File / From Computer" mode (Add Subtitles to Playlist/Folder-2.png).
- Settings sidebar (400x946): tabs Playback / Video / Audio / Subtitles. Toggling "Show Subtitle Timeline on Seekbar" switches the seek bar into subtitle-timeline mode (times "00:01:50*" / "00:02:40*"). Expand Settings / Collapse Settings toggle filter cards instantly. Dropdowns (Setting Preset, EQ presets, HDR Options, Audio Visualizer, sub filename, Dropdown) open on click. "Open Advanced Settings" opens the Settings dialog on the matching category (Audio -> Settings - audio.png, Subtitles -> Settings - subtitles.png, Video -> Settings - video.png).
- Queue panel (400x946): tabs Queue / Bookmarks / Chapters.

Top bar and windows
- "..." (top-left) opens the main menu overlay (menu.png) 17 px right / 38 px below. Menu: Settings -> Settings - global.png overlay; Keyboard Shortcuts -> Keyboard Shortcuts.png overlay; Customize Player -> Player - customize.png; Profile (Movies) -> swaps to Profiles.png (submenu open).
- Sidebar toggle icon and the folder chip ("Videos" / "S01" / "My Songs") open and close the compact library: smart animate, "slow" easing, 208 ms.
- Key F: Player -> Player - hide UI.png and back (smart animate, ease-in-and-out, 300 ms).
- Key V: opens Add Subtitles (Add Subtitles to Playlist/Folder.png) from any player screen.

Library sidebar (component `sidebar`, 10 variants)
- Rail icons (Home, Videos, Music, Network, Playlists, Recent) switch the panel content; rail icons hover to `#FFFFFF 6%` background.
- Drill-down: Videos -> Shows -> The Wand -> S01 / S02; Music -> Songs -> My Songs; "..." in the breadcrumb and earlier breadcrumb segments go back up.
- Rows (`media`, 337x32): hover changes unwatched/watched rows to their hover variants (title becomes `Dark/FG/2`, a "..." button appears). "..." on a row opens file context menu.png; "..." in the panel header opens folder context menu.png; "..." on a playlist opens playlist context menu.png; sort icon opens Sorting Options.png; grid/list icon opens View Options.png (both 11 px left / 30 px below the icon). Picking Grid View / List View switches the full library screen.
- Clicking a song row plays it in the music player (Player - Music.png).
- Mini player (Miniplayer, 391x339): hover shows the overlay controls; the queue button expands it upward to 391x690 with the queue; dragging moves it between the four corners (Player-1..Player-4.png, smart animate ease-out 300 ms); X and the open icon go back to the player.

Dialogs
- Add Subtitles: target dropdown (To This File / To This Folder / To This Playlist) and source dropdown (From Computer / From OpenSubtitles) swap between the four dialog frames; "subtitle one" rows toggle selected on click; "subtitle multiple" rows hover. Save and X close the overlay.
- Settings dialog: category rows swap the dialog to that category's frame; "Advanced Options" toggles between the basic and the -1 (expanded) frame; Theme and Size values segmented controls switch on click; toggles flip ON/OFF; Startup volume rows select.
- Keyboard Shortcuts, Open Network Stream, New Playlist: X closes; no other wiring.
- Onboarding: Next / Back between the three screens; the 9 color frames (Onboarding-3..10) exist but are not wired.
- Customize Player: the drag sequence seek bar -> top bar items -> title -> folder chip -> fullscreen -> Favorite (each drag smart animate 50 ms, the last one 600 ms) ends at Player - customize-6.png; Save shows the alternate layout (Player - customize-7.png); its sidebar toggle / folder chip open the library (Player - customize-8.png); Cancel and X go back to the player.

## Prototype wiring that is not design intent (do not build)
- Main menu "About VLC" -> Customize screen; right-click "More Settings", "Open Media", "Quit VLC" -> Customize screen; right-click "Playlist" -> Keyboard Shortcuts dialog. These are demo shortcuts in the prototype.
- Clicking any Customize palette item (Backward 15s, Bookmarks, Chapters, Favorite, Forward 15s, Go Home, Properties, Quit, Replay, Settings, Thumbnail, Sidebar) navigates to Player.png: demo only.
- Clicking the seek row to toggle the waveform: demo of the "Show Waveform on Seekbar" option, not a real click behavior.
- Key V -> Add Subtitles and key F -> Hide UI: probably demo hotkeys (see Conflicts).

## Cross-check with VIDEO_INDEX.md and the video

Interactions the Figma prototype shows that VIDEO_INDEX.md did not have were added to VIDEO_INDEX.md as rows F-01 to F-23 (section "Items from the Figma prototype").

### Conflicts between the Figma prototype and the video

## Interactions per screen

Each row is a unique interaction; (xN) = the same element and action repeated N times in that frame. "state a -> b" = the element swaps to another variant of its component (hover or pressed look, toggle, tab switch). Triggers: click, hover (state lasts while hovered), drag, key. Transitions: instant unless stated.
