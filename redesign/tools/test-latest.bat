rem Test VLC Redesign: downloads the newest successful build of the redesign branch from
rem GitHub Actions and starts it in portable mode (its own settings, never the installed VLC's).
rem Builds are downloaded to "%BUILDS%\<run number>" (a run that is already there is not
rem downloaded again) and copied into a fixed folder the player runs from, so Windows Firewall
rem asks only once per program path and the portable settings stay in one place:
rem   "public" builds (Cone.exe, the default since Decision 50) -> builds\current-public
rem   "vlc" builds (vlc.exe, started by hand with the vlc profile) -> builds\current
