**Cone** is a media player for Windows: the playback engine of VLC media player with a new interface built from Juxtopposed's VLC Redesign.

> **Experimental build.** Cone follows the development branch of VLC 4 (VLC version {{VLC_VERSION}} inside), so expect rough edges and bugs. Keep your normal VLC installed: Cone installs next to it with its own settings, file associations and data folder, and never changes VLC's.

## Downloads

| File | What it is | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `{{EXE}}` | Installer for Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit) | `{{EXE_SHA256}}` |
| `{{ZIP}}` | Zip: unpack anywhere and run `Cone.exe`, no installation (settings go to `%APPDATA%\Cone`; create an empty folder named `portable` next to `Cone.exe` to keep them there instead) | `{{ZIP_SHA256}}` |

`SHA256SUMS.txt` holds both checksums. To check a download in PowerShell, run `Get-FileHash .\{{EXE}} -Algorithm SHA256` and compare the result with the table above.

The files are not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn the first time: choose "More info", then "Run anyway".
