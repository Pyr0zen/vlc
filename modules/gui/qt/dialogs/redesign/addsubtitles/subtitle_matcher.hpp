/**
 * redesign (Add Subtitles, W6.5, P3-02 / P3-08 / P3-09): matches subtitle files to the videos
 * they belong to by what the names mean, not by how they are written: the designer's folder has
 * "The_Wand_S01E04.mp4" next to "thewand_s01e04.srt", which VLC's own file name matching misses.
 *
 * A name is read as a title, an episode (S01E04, 1x04, "Episode 4", E04, a lone number) and
 * what follows the episode (language, "forced", "SDH" ...: the variant). A subtitle matches a
 * video when the episodes agree (or, for names without an episode, when the titles agree); among
 * the matches of an episode the preferred variant and language win, so a choice made by hand
 * once ("_English" instead of "_Spanish") is kept for the next episodes.
 *
 * Pure functions on names only (no file access), safe on any thread.
