/**
 * redesign (Add Subtitles, W6.5, P3-08 / P3-09): what the dialog saved, so it applies again
 * every time a video plays (video 6:12-6:22: subtitles added to a folder are matched to its
 * episodes, and a match picked by hand is kept for the next episodes).
 *
 * - per video: the subtitle files added to it;
 * - per folder: where its subtitles come from (a folder of the computer or an OpenSubtitles
 *   search), and the variant and language picked by hand, so episodes played later (new
 *   files too) get theirs matched the same way.
 *
 * Kept as JSON in VLC's user data folder. The object itself lives on the interface thread;
 * read() and write() do the file work and belong on a worker thread.
