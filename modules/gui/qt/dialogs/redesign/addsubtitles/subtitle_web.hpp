/**
 * redesign (Add Subtitles, W6.5): the web requests of the dialog's "From OpenSubtitles" and
 * "From Link" sources. VLC's Qt is built without Qt Network, so they go through VLC itself:
 * JSON API calls with their own headers over VLC's TLS sockets (vlc_tls), file downloads
 * through VLC's access modules (vlc_stream_NewURL, which follow redirects).
 *
 * Every call blocks: run them on a worker thread only. They stop when the thread's VLC
 * interrupt context (vlc_interrupt_set) is killed, which is how the dialog cancels them.
