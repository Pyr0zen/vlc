// redesign: takes the mouse wheel that nothing inside an overlay (card, panel, sidebar) used, so it
// never reaches what lies behind it: the player turns the wheel into volume or seek, a library list
// would scroll (Decision 51). It fills the overlay under its content, so the overlay's lists and
// sliders still get the wheel first. Takes no clicks and no hover.
