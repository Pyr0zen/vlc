// redesign: mouse wheel fine-tuning of a slider (Decision 54). Over its area (the slider's bar and
// label row) one wheel notch is one step: `stepped(steps)`, positive to increase (wheel up or
// right; on a mirrored horizontal slider right decreases, like the arrow keys). Takes no clicks.
// The slider moves its value as for a drag or a key step (RdSliderCommit paces what reaches
// VLC); stepSlider(slider, steps) does it for a plain T.Slider.
// - Who gets the wheel: in a view that can scroll (an enclosing Flickable / ListView / ScrollView
//   whose content is taller than it, `inScrollingView`, read live: a window resize or an expander
//   can change it) the wheel scrolls the view and never moves a slider the pointer only passes
//   over. There the slider takes it only while `armed`: a click on the slider or on its value
//   row arms it (arm(); the owner calls it), and it is released when the pointer leaves the
//   slider's zone (`zoneHovered`: the bar and label row, or with a value row the row and the
//   slider), when the window loses focus, or when the slider hides or is disabled. `holding` is
//   true while an armed slider keeps the wheel from a scrolling view: the slider shows a subtle
//   focus state; meanwhile its value row takes the wheel too (take()). In a view that cannot
//   scroll, or outside any view, hovering is enough.
// - Every wheel event the slider takes is taken also at its ends, so it never scrolls the list or
//   reaches the player behind it; one it leaves goes on to the view.
// - High-resolution wheels and touchpads send fractions of a notch: they add up to whole steps
//   (angleDelta, 120 per notch; pixelDelta, `pixelsPerStep` per step, where only that is sent);
//   a remainder is dropped after `gestureGap` ms without a wheel event or on a change of direction.
// - Natural scrolling reported by the system (`inverted`: macOS, Linux) is turned back to the
//   finger direction; on Windows a touchpad follows the scroll direction set in Windows, as for a
//   wheel.
