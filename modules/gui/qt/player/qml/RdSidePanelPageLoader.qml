// redesign: one page of the right sidebar (RdSidePanel), created on first use (INTERACTIONS.md
// section 0): when its tab is selected the first time (synchronously, so it shows in the same
// frame), or in the background once the sidebar has been shown, so that switching tabs is
// instant. Once created the page is kept. The page cross-fades when its tab is selected (video
// 8:40, IA-37).
