/**
 * redesign: the waveform of the playing file, for the waveform seek bar (P6-06, IB-24; the
 * Playback tab's "Show Waveform on Seekbar").
 *
 * Nothing runs until a seek bar asks for it (acquire(), while the option is on). Then the
 * playing file's loudness profile is read from the cache, or scanned (RdWaveformScanner) on a
 * single worker thread at the lowest priority, so playback and the UI never wait for it. A
 * media change cancels the scan in flight; so does the last seek bar letting go (release()).
 *
 * Only local files are scanned (a stream would be read a second time over the network), and
 * only once the player knows their duration.
 *
 * Cache: one small file per scanned file in `<VLC user data folder>/waveforms`, named after
 * the file's path, size and modification time (an edited file is scanned again). A file with
 * no usable audio is remembered too, so it is not scanned on every visit. At most
 * `kCacheMaxEntries` files are kept (about 1 KB each); the least recently used go first.
