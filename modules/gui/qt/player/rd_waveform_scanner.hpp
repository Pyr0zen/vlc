/**
 * redesign: the loudness profile of a file's audio, for the waveform seek bar (P6-06, IB-24).
 *
 * Opens the file a second time with VLC's own access, demuxer, packetizer and audio decoder
 * (the same modules playback uses, no audio output, no clock) and measures the loudness of
 * the first audio track over `kBins` equal slices of the file's duration.
 *
 * - A full scan decodes the file from start to end, as fast as the decoder goes, but it reads
 *   every byte of the file, video included. So it is only for files where that is quick: any
 *   file up to `kFullScanMaxBytes`, and a file without video (music: every byte read is audio
 *   the waveform needs) up to `kAudioFullScanMaxBytes`. Their waveform is exact.
 * - Other files (videos over `kFullScanMaxBytes`, long audio recordings) are sampled: one short
 *   stretch of audio is decoded in each slice, so a 50 GB file costs at most about `kBins`
 *   seeks, not a full read. A stretch is never longer than its slice. The stretches are read in
 *   order: the scan seeks to a stretch only when reading on to it would cost more than the
 *   seek (stretches that touch, in a file up to `kBins` x 0.25 s, are read once from the start),
 *   and the audio packets before a stretch (from the keyframe an MP4 seek lands on, or between
 *   two stretches) are dropped before the packetizer, undecoded, except a short decoder
 *   warm-up. A video track that only shows up while a full scan reads (MPEG-PS) moves a file
 *   over `kFullScanMaxBytes` to the sampled scan. A file to sample that the demuxer cannot seek
 *   in gets no waveform rather than a full read.
 *
 * run() blocks and is meant for a low priority worker thread. cancel() may be called from any
 * thread: run() then returns an empty array within one demuxed packet (the VLC interrupt
 * context of the run also aborts blocking reads). A run never lasts much longer than
 * `kTimeBudgetSeconds`: past it, the file gets no waveform.
 *
 * Result: `kBins` bytes, the RMS loudness of each slice scaled so the loudest slice is 255;
 * empty when the file has no decodable audio, no known duration, or the run was cancelled.
