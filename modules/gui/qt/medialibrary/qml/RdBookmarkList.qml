// redesign: bookmarks of the current file in the queue sidebar's Bookmarks tab (video
// 15:08-15:16). Part of the media library module: VLC keeps bookmarks in the media library, so
// the sidebar loads this list only when the media library is available. The rows are created on
// demand (RdListView). The header's "+" adds a bookmark at the current time, like Ctrl+B
// (W4.8b); a click on a row jumps to it and selects it for the header's "-".
