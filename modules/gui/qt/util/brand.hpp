/**
 * redesign: brand layer, the one definition of the app's name and logo inside the interface
 * (redesign/BUILD_NOTES.md "Brand layer (vlc / public profiles)").
 *
 * One build input picks the profile: configure --with-brand=vlc|public (meson -Dbrand=...,
 * extras/package/win32/build.sh -B, the build-windows workflow's "brand" input). The "public"
 * profile defines VLC_BRAND_PUBLIC in config.h.
 * - vlc (default): VLC's name and cone, exactly what the interface showed before this layer.
 * - public: "Cone" with Sticky's logo (pixmaps/brand/public). Layout, colors, fonts, the accent
 *   and the cone-shaped volume slider are the same in both profiles.
 *
 * The texts are macros so qtr() keeps looking up VLC's exact source strings, and so their VLC
 * translations, in the vlc profile. The packaging side (exe name, version info, installer) is
 * set by configure.ac / meson.build from the same input.
