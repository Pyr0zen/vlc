/**
 * redesign: the "Test" button next to Stereo Mode in the settings sidebar's Audio tab (video
 * 8:41, Figma "audio settings" 2250:9842). VLC has no test sound: this plays a short generated
 * one, a tone on the left channel then on the right, so the user hears which speaker plays
 * what. The stereo mode chosen for the playing file (Mono, Left, Right, Reverse stereo) is
 * applied to the tone, so the test sounds like the mode does.
 *
 * The tone plays on its own player (the playing file is not interrupted), on the device of the
 * player's audio output, without the audio effects, visualization or speed of the playing file.
 * The sound files are written once per stereo mode into a temporary folder removed on exit.
